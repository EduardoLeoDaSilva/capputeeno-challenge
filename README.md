This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is next.js challenge, where I had to develop a next.js app based on a figma prototype, on this project I used server/static rendering, and some next functionalities.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies with npm install run the json-server, which I used for provide the necessary data for the next app.

```bash
npm install
```
Then, run the json-server, which I used for providing the necessary data for the next app consuption.

```bash
npx json-server db.json --port 3001
```
And finally, run the script for running the next app:

```
npm run dev
```
